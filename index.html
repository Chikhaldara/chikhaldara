<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">A new adventure in Chikhaldara</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 32px; margin-bottom:50px;">Hello, i am Faizan Kamil from Chikhaldra.Chikhaldara is a hill station and a municipal council in Amravati district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.<br>Chikaldhara, literally translates from Marathi to mud stream/falls (chikal + dhara). Hindus claim that this place was featured in the epic of the Mahabharata, this is the place where Bheema killed the villainous Keechaka in a herculean bout and then threw him into the valley. It thus came to be known as Keechakadara which eventually colloquialised to Chikaldhara. There is, however, not much evidence apart from hearsay to support that argument.
